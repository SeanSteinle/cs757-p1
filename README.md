# CS757, Project I: Music with VAEs!
*Kyarash Aminfar, Sean Steinle*

## Getting Started

To get started you need to set up both the data directory and a Python virtual environment.

### Data

First, head [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/basu369victor/generate-music-with-variational-autoencoder/notebook) and download a zip of the required data (under 'inputs'). Then unzip in the `data/` directory.

### Environment

For now, I've been able to do everything I need to do with Python 3.7 and the `requirements.txt` file. If things get more complicated, we can use Docker! For now though, just create a virtual environment and `pip install -r requirements.txt` away.
